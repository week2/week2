# Learned about some loops using

i = 1

while i <= 5 # while the varible i is less than 5, print it and then add 1 to it
  print(i)
  i = i + 1
  
# and also learned about lists:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

numbers.insert(0, -1)
> [-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

numbers.remove(3)
> [-1, 1, 2, 4, 5]

print(1 in numbers)
> True # 1 is in the list

print(len(numbers))
> 5 # since 5 numbers

# and for loops

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  for item in numbers: # it can change over any number in the list and in each edit, this item varible holds a value.
    print(item)
    
# and while loops too

i = 0
while i < len(numbers): # while i is less than the length of numbers, 5, then print the value of i
    print(numbers[i])
    i = i + 1 # adds one to i, meaning will be 1, 2, etc
